\description{
The R.J. Cook Agronomy Farm (cookfarm) is a Long-Term Agroecosystem Research
Site operated by Washington State University, located near Pullman,
Washington, USA. Contains spatio-temporal (3D+T) measurements of three soil
properties and a number of spatial and temporal regression covariates.

Here, only the "Profiles" dataset is used from the collection.
The \code{Date} column was appended from the \code{readings} dataset.
In addition coordinates were appended to the task as variables \code{"x"} and \code{"y"}.

The dataset was borrowed and adapted from package GSIF which was on archived on
CRAN in 2021-03.

\section{Column roles}{

The task has set column roles "space" and "time" for variables \code{"Date"} and
\code{"SOURCEID"}, respectively.
These are used by certain methods during partitioning, e.g.,
\code{mlr_resamplings_sptcv_cstf} with variant "Leave-location-and-time-out".
If only one of space or time should left out, the column roles must be
adjusted by the user!
