abstract = {Abstract Clinical data from paired organs present a dependence structure that has to be considered when making statistical inference or evaluating classification rules with resampling-based techniques (bootstrap, cross-validation). We introduce a paired cross-validation approach for the estimation of misclassification error rates in the classification of data from paired organs. The dependence structure of the sample is honored by subject-level cross-validation. Theoretical considerations as well as a case–control study on glaucoma diagnosis and a simulation study show that the variance of the paired cross-validation estimator is considerably lower than in traditional cross-validation error estimation on one randomly selected eye per subject. The actual variance reduction is mainly controlled by the contribution of differential misclassification between both eyes to the overall error rate. By contrast, ‘ad hoc’ cross-validation ignoring the autocorrelation of paired organs leads to biased error estimates. Using the double-bagging technique, we also show that classification accuracy can be improved by using information from both eyes in training machine-learning classifiers. In glaucoma detection, the reduction in misclassification error rates by training data from both eyes is equivalent to an increase in the sample size by one-third to one-half, which is an important achievement in clinical studies.},

Cook Agronomy Farm, USA. Performance of a random k-fold cross-validation (CV) was compared to three target-oriented strategies: Leave-Location-Out (LLO), Leave-Time-Out (LTO), and Leave-Location-and-Time-Out (LLTO) CV. Results indicate that considerable differences between random k-fold (R2~=~0.9 for Tair and 0.92 for VW) and target-oriented CV (LLO R2~=~0.24 for Tair and 0.49 for VW) exist, highlighting the need for target-oriented validation to avoid an overoptimistic view on models. Differences between random k-fold and target-oriented CV indicate spatial over-fitting caused by misleading variables. To decrease over-fitting, a forward feature selection in conjunction with target-oriented CV is proposed. It decreased over-fitting and simultaneously improved target-oriented performances (LLO CV R2~=~0.47 for Tair and 0.55 for VW).},

  abstract = {Aim Processes and variables measured in ecology are almost always spatially autocorrelated, potentially leading to the choice of overly complex models when performing variable selection. One way to solve this problem is to account for residual spatial autocorrelation (RSA) for each subset of variables considered and then use a classical model selection criterion such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC). However, this method can be laborious and it raises other concerns such as which spatial model to use or how to compare different spatial models. To improve the accuracy of variable selection in ecology, this study evaluates an alternative method based on a spatial cross-validation procedure. Such a procedure is usually used for model evaluation but can also provide interesting outcomes for variable selection in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Innovation We propose to use a special case of spatial cross-validation, spatial leave-one-out (SLOO), giving a criterion equivalent to the AIC in the absence of spatial autocorrelation. SLOO only computes non-spatial models and uses a threshold distance (equal to the range of RSA) to keep each point left out spatially independent from the others. We first provide some simulations to evaluate how SLOO performs compared with AIC. We then assess the robustness of SLOO on a large-scale dataset. R software codes are provided for generalized linear models. Main conclusions The AIC was relevant for variable selection in the presence of RSA if the independent variables considered were not spatially autocorrelated. It otherwise failed because highly spatially autocorrelated variables were more often selected than others. Conversely, SLOO had similar performances whether the variables were themselves spatially autocorrelated or not. It was particularly useful when the range of RSA was small, which is a common property of spatial tools. SLOO appears to be a promising solution for selecting relevant variables from most ecological spatial datasets.},
