  abstract = {The statistical metrics used to characterize the external predictivity of a model, i.e., how well it predicts the properties of an independent test set, have proliferated over the past decade. This paper clarifies some apparent confusion over the use of the coefficient of determination, R2, as a measure of model fit and predictive power in QSAR and QSPR modelling., R2 (or R2) has been used in various contexts in the literature in conjunction with training and test data, for both ordinary linear regression and regression through the origin as well as with linear and nonlinear regression models. We analyze the widely adopted model fit criteria suggested by Golbraikh and Tropsha in a strict statistical manner. Shortcomings in these criteria are identified and a clearer and simpler alternative method to characterize model predictivity is provided. The intent is not to repeat the well-documented arguments for model validation using test data, but to guide the application of R2 as a model fit statistic., Examples are used to illustrate both correct and incorrect use of R2. Reporting the root mean squared error or equivalent measures of dispersion, typically of more practical importance than R2, is also encouraged and important challenges in addressing the needs of different categories of users such as computational chemists, experimental scientists, and regulatory decision support specialists are outlined.},

  abstract = {Identifying how habitat use is influenced by environmental heterogeneity at different scales is central to understanding ungulate population dynamics on complex landscapes. We used resource selection functions (RSF) to study summer habitat use in a reintroduced and expanding elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) population in the Chequamegon National Forest, Wisconsin, USA. Factors were examined that influenced where elk established home ranges and that influenced habitat use within established home ranges. We also determined grain sizes over which elk responded to environmental heterogeneity and the number of categories of habitat selection from low to high that the elk distinguished. At a large spatial extent, elk home-range establishment was largely explained by the spatial distribution of wolf (Canis lupus) territories. Forage abundance was also influential but was relatively more important at a small spatial extent when elk moved within established home ranges. Areas near roads were avoided when establishing a home-range, but areas near roads were selected for use within the established home range. Elk distinguished among 4 different categories of habitat selection when establishing and moving within home ranges. Spatial and temporal cross validation demonstrated that to improve the predictive strength of habitat models in areas of low inter-annual variability in the environment, it is better to follow more individuals across diverse environmental conditions than to follow the same individuals over a longer time period. Last, our results show that the effects of environmental variables on habitat use were scale-dependent and reemphasize the necessity of analyzing habitat use at multiple scales that are fit to address specific research questions.},

To address this issue, we developed and compared different modeling approaches to impute missing daily average particulate matter (PM10) data between 2010 and 2017 using spatiotemporal predictor variables. The random forest (RF) machine learning method was used to explore the relationship between average daily PM10 concentrations and spatiotemporal predictors like meteorological, land use and source-related variables. National (8 models), provincial (32) and site-specific (44) RF models were developed to impute missing daily PM10 data. The annual national, provincial and site-specific RF cross-validation (CV) models explained on average 78\%, 70\% and 55\% of ground-level PM10 concentrations, respectively. The spatial components of the national and provincial CV RF models explained on average 22\% and 48\%, while the temporal components of the national, provincial and site-specific CV RF models explained on average 78\%, 68\% and 57\% of ground-level PM10 concentrations, respectively.

Empirical models of mountain permafrost distribution based on rock glacier activity status and temperature data have been established as a tool for regional-scale assessments of its distribution; this kind of model approach has never been applied for a large portion of the Andes. In the present study, this methodology is applied to map permafrost favourability throughout the semi-arid Andes of central Chile (29\textendash 32\textdegree{} S), excluding areas of exposed bedrock. After spatially modelling of the mean annual air temperature distribution from scarce temperature records (116 station years) using a linear mixed-effects model, a generalized additive model was built to model the activity status of 3524 rock glaciers. A permafrost favourability index (PFI) was obtained by adjusting model predictions for conceptual differences between permafrost and rock glacier distribution. The results indicate that the model has an acceptable performance (median AUROC: 0.76). Conditions highly favourable to permafrost presence (PFI {$\geq$} 0.75) are predicted for 1051 km\textsuperscript{2} of mountain terrain, or 2.7 \% of the total area of the watersheds studied. Favourable conditions are expected to occur in 2636 km\textsuperscript{2}, or 6.8 \% of the area. Substantial portions of the Elqui and Huasco watersheds are considered to be favourable for permafrost presence (11.8 \% each), while in the Limar\'i and Choapa watersheds permafrost is expected to be mostly limited to specific sub-watersheds. In the future, local ground-truth observations will be required to confirm permafrost presence in favourable areas and to monitor permafrost evolution under the influence of climate change.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here we show that tropical PAs overall reduced deforestation carbon emissions by 4.88 Pg, or around 29\%, between 2000 and 2012, when compared to expected rates of deforestation controlling for spatial variation in deforestation pressure. The largest contribution was from the tropical Americas (368.8 TgC y-1), followed by Asia (25.0 TgC y-1) and Africa (12.7 TgC y-1). Variation in PA effectiveness is largely driven by local factors affecting individual PAs, rather than designations assigned by governments.},

In order to be able to draw statistically convincing conclusions, it is important to estimate the uncertainty of such estimates. This paper studies the very commonly used K-fold cross-validation estimator of generalization performance. The main theorem shows that there exists no universal (valid under all distributions) unbiased estimator of the variance of K-fold cross-validation. The analysis that accompanies this result is based on the eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrix of errors, which has only three different eigenvalues corresponding to three degrees of freedom of the matrix and three components of the total variance. This analysis helps to better understand the nature of the problem and how it can make naive estimators (that don't take into account the error correlations due to the overlap between training and test sets) grossly underestimate variance. This is confirmed by numerical experiments in which the three components of the variance are compared when the difficulty of the learning problem and the number of folds are varied.},

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in Australia's temperate forests have been overlooked in national soil databases and in global SOC analyses of natural ecosystems despite the importance of temperate forests to the global terrestrial carbon balance. This limits the potential to both predict change in SOC stocks in temperate Australia and to identify where and how SOC stocks can be managed to mitigate climate change. Based on data from 707 sites, we examine variations in SOC concentrations and stocks across a range of natural temperate broadleaf forests in south-eastern Australia. Comparisons with current Australia-wide databases highlight previous under-estimation of forest SOC concentrations, leading to substantial underprediction of SOC stocks in the most productive forests (e.g. this study's mean of 207~Mg C ha-1 compared with a database mean estimate of 141~Mg C ha-1 for Tall open-forests to 30-cm soil depth). Random Forest models involving 27 environmental variables (representing climate, terrain, parent material, soil attributes, vegetation, and fire history) explained up to 79\% of the variation in SOC concentrations and 77\% of the variation in SOC stocks to 30-cm depth. Climate variables (precipitation, temperature) were of greatest importance to the prediction of both SOC concentrations and SOC stocks, tending to override the importance of terrain and fire-history variables at this study's regional scale. While patterns in SOC concentrations and stocks were correlated, SOC concentrations were not a reliable proxy for SOC stocks to 10-cm depth, reiterating the importance of mass equivalent measures (i.e. soil bulk density) to assessing changes in soil carbon storage. Our study provides a timely check of the model-based estimates of SOC concentrations and stocks in Australia's temperate forests that are currently available in nation-wide databases and improves the available information for defining benchmarks, and for identifying potential areas of SOC loss and gain, in programs that aim to mitigate climate change.},

However, when it comes to time series forecasting, because of the inherent serial correlation and potential non-stationarity of the data, its application is not straightforward and often replaced by practitioners in favour of an out-of-sample (OOS) evaluation. It is shown that for purely autoregressive models, the use of standard K-fold CV is possible provided the models considered have uncorrelated errors. Such a setup occurs, for example, when the models nest a more appropriate model. This is very common when Machine Learning methods are used for prediction, and where CV can control for overfitting the data. Theoretical insights supporting these arguments are presented, along with a simulation study and a real-world example. It is shown empirically that K-fold CV performs favourably compared to both OOS evaluation and other time-series-specific techniques such as non-dependent cross-validation.},

  abstract = {Rock glaciers and transitional ice-debris complexes predominate the Central Andean landform assemblage, yet regional studies on their state of activity and their kinematics remain sparse. Here we utilize the national glacier inventory of Argentina to quantify surface velocity fields of 244 rock glaciers and 51 ice-debris complexes, located in the Cord\'on del Plata range, Argentina. Applying a feature-tracking approach to repeated RapidEye satellite imagery acquired between 2010 and 2017/18, we find mean displacement rates between 0.37 and 2.61 m year-1 for 149 landforms, while for the remaining 146 features, surface movement remains below our level of detection. We compare our satellite-derived velocity fields with ground-truth data from two local field sites and find closely matching results in magnitude and spatial distribution. With average displacement of one-third of the active rock glaciers and ice-debris complexes exceeding 1 m year-1, the region hosts an exceptional number of fast-flowing periglacial landforms, compared to other mountain belts. Using a random forest model, we test the predictive power of 25 morphometric and topoclimatic candidate predictors for modelling the state of activity of rock glaciers and ice-debris complexes on two different scales. For entire landforms and individual landform segments, constructed along displacement centrelines, we can predict the state of activity with overall accuracies of 70.08\% (mean AUROC = 0.785) and 74.86\% (mean AUROC = 0.753), respectively. While topoclimatic parameters such as solar radiation and elevation are most important for entire landforms, geometric parameters become more important at the scale of landform segments. Despite tentative correlations between local slope and surface kinematics, our results point to factors integrating slope and distance to the source to govern local deformation. We conclude that feature tracking in optical imagery is feasible for regional studies in remote regions and provides valuable insight into the current state of the Andean cryosphere. \textcopyright{} 2020 The Authors.

We introduce a paired cross-validation approach for the estimation of misclassification error rates in the classification of data from paired organs. The dependence structure of the sample is honored by subject-level cross-validation. Theoretical considerations as well as a case-control study on glaucoma diagnosis and a simulation study show that the variance of the paired cross-validation estimator is considerably lower than in traditional cross-validation error estimation on one randomly selected eye per subject. The actual variance reduction is mainly controlled by the contribution of differential misclassification between both eyes to the overall error rate. By contrast, 'ad hoc' cross-validation ignoring the autocorrelation of paired organs leads to biased error estimates. Using the double-bagging technique, we also show that classification accuracy can be improved by using information from both eyes in training machine-learning classifiers. In glaucoma detection, the reduction in misclassification error rates by training data from both eyes is equivalent to an increase in the sample size by one-third to one-half, which is an important achievement in clinical studies.},

For this purpose we compare the predictive performances achieved using terrain attributes derived from TanDEM-X DEM (12 m resolution and resampled to 30 m), ASTER DEM (30 m), SRTM DEM (30 m), and a DEM (25 m) interpolated from contour lines (1:25.000 map scale), exploiting the capabilities of logistic regression, generalized additive models, random forests and support vector machines. The study was conducted in the Buz\u{a}u Sector of the Curvature Subcarpathians of Romania, a region highly susceptible to landslides. While the performances varied little among modelling techniques, the use of different DEMs strongly influenced the cross-validation accuracy of landslide susceptibility models. TanDEM-X (12 m) based susceptibility models outperformed models based on the other DEMs (median Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUROC) values 0.708\textendash 0.730). Models using ASTER-derived terrain attributes showed the poorest predictive capabilities (median AUROC 0.568\textendash 0.595). We conclude that the quality of DEMs is of critical importance in landslide susceptibility modelling, and greater efforts should be made to obtain suitable DEM products.},

We targeted Vipera ursinii ursinii, a meadow viper from southeastern France and central Italy, to assess determinants of transferability among geographically disjunct populations. We fitted HSMs upon occurrences of the Italian and French populations separately, as well as on the combined occurrence dataset. Internal transferability of HSMs, on spatially independent test data drawn from the calibration region, and their external transferability on the geographically disjunct populations were evaluated according to (a) use of full or spatially rarefied presence datasets; (b) ecology-driven or statistics-driven filtering of predictors; (c) modeling algorithm, testing generalized additive models and gradient boosting models; and (d) multivariate environmental novelty within test data. Niche overlap between French and Italian populations was also tested. Niche overlap was low, but niche divergence between the two populations' clusters was not corroborated. Nonetheless, wider niche breadth and heterogeneity of background environmental conditions characterizing the French populations led to low intercluster transferability. Although models fitted on the combined datasets did not attain consistently higher internal transferability than those separately fitted for the French and Italian populations, ensemble projection from the HSMs fitted on the joint occurrences produced more consistent suitability predictions across the full range of V. u. ursinii. Spatial thinning of occurrences ameliorated internal transferability but did not affect external transferability. The two approaches to predictors filtering did not differ in transferability of the respective HSMs but led to discrepant estimated environment\textendash occurrence relationships and spatial predictions, while the two algorithms attained different relative rankings depending on the considered prediction task. Multivariate novelty of projection sites was negatively correlated to both internal transferability and external transferability. Our findings clarify issues researchers should keep in mind when using HSMs to get predictions across geographically disjunct populations.},

A new digital map of the spatial distribution of seafloor lithologies below 500 m water depth is presented to address this shortcoming. The lithology map is accompanied by estimates of the probability of the most probable class, which may be interpreted as a spatially explicit measure of confidence in the predictions, and probabilities for the occurrence of five lithology classes (calcareous sediment, clay, diatom ooze, lithogenous sediment, and radiolarian ooze). These map products were derived by the application of the random-forest machine-learning algorithm to a homogenised dataset of seafloor lithology samples and global environmental predictor variables that were selected based on the current understanding of the controls on the spatial distribution of deep-sea sediments. It is expected that the map products are useful for various purposes including, but not limited to, teaching, management, spatial planning, design of marine protected areas, and as input for global spatial predictions of marine species distributions and seafloor sediment properties.

However, relatively few HDMs include oceanographic predictors, or present spatial validity or uncertainty analyses to support the classified predictions. Without reference studies it can be challenging to assess which type of oceanographic model data should be used, or developed, for this purpose. In this study, we compare biotope maps built using predictor variable suites from three different oceanographic models with differing levels of detail on near-bottom conditions. These results are compared with a baseline model without oceanographic predictors. We use associated spatial validity and uncertainty analyses to assess which oceanographic data may be best suited to biotope mapping. Our results show how spatial validity and uncertainty metrics capture differences between HDM outputs which are otherwise not apparent from standard non-spatial accuracy assessments or the classified maps themselves. We conclude that biotope HDMs incorporating high-resolution, preferably bottom-optimised, oceanography data can best minimise spatial uncertainty and maximise spatial validity. Furthermore, our results suggest that incorporating coarser oceanographic data may lead to more uncertainty than omitting such data.},

However, the automated detection of tree species based on passive remote sensing data from aerial surveys is still not sufficiently developed to achieve reliable results independent of the phenological stage, time of day, season, tree vitality and prevailing atmospheric conditions. Here, we introduce a novel tree species classification approach based on high resolution RGB image data gathered during automated UAV flights that overcomes these insufficiencies. For the classification task, a computationally lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed. We show that with the chosen CNN model architecture, average classification accuracies of 92\% can be reached independently of the illumination conditions and the phenological stages of four different tree species. We also show that a minimal ground sampling density of 1.6 cm/px is needed for the classification model to be able to make use of the spatial-structural information in the data. Finally, to demonstrate the applicability of the presented approach to derive spatially explicit tree species information, a gridded product is generated that yields an average classification accuracy of 88\%.},

In order to make an informed decision land managers need to be able to predict the spread of these invasive species at local scales and without the need for excessive sampling. Our approach uses a hybrid model, combining habitat suitability and the presence of the invasive in neighbouring cells to predict the probability of a cell being invaded over time. A generalized linear mixed-effects model was used to create a habitat suitability model and a spread model. The habitat suitability model predicts the presence of buckthorn based on environmental characteristics and the results are used in the spread model. The spread model indicates that the invasion of buckthorn is influenced by the suitability of habitat and the presence of buckthorn in neighbouring cells. The success of the spread model suggests that this approach can be used to create a spatiotemporally explicit model with limited sampling effort.},

Interaction partners are often assumed to react differently to climate change, causing spatial mismatches in future distributions and increased extinction risks. We compare potential direct effects of climate change with combined direct and indirect effects mediated via food plants on a highly specialized bird species. Location Europe. Taxon European spotted nutcracker (Nucifraga caryocatactes). Methods We used climate-based species distribution models to project probabilities of occurrence of European spotted nutcrackers and their main food sources, Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra) and common hazel (Corylus avellana) under climate change. We combined direct climate change effects on the bird and indirect effects via the food plants by calculating the probabilities of plants and nutcrackers occurring together. Results We find considerable projected northward shifts in future occurrences of nutcrackers under climate change and similar effects on hazel. In contrast, projections for Swiss stone pine indicate minor altitudinal upward shifts. Combined projections of direct and indirect effects of climate change indicate less pronounced shifts of nutcrackers' occurrences, due to relatively small changes in pine's occurrences and to suitable hazel occurrence shifts. Main conclusions Our study suggests that potential effects of climate change on the future distribution of the nutcracker might be overestimated when ignoring trophically interacting plants in future projections. Models of direct effects of climate change on nutcrackers' occurrence probabilities project greater range losses than models of combined direct and indirect effects via resource plants. Therefore, considering biotic interactions does not necessarily increase the risks that climate change may impose on species distributions, but could reduce overestimation of potential range losses in rapidly changing environments.},

In order to determine the impact of Pleistocene climatic fluctuations on the tropical rain forests of western Ecuador, we explored the evolutionary history of the endemic palm Phytelephas aequatorialis. Location Western Ecuador, north-western South America. Taxon Phytelephas aequatorialis (Arecaceae). Methods One hundred and seventy-six nuclear genes were sequenced in 91 individuals for phylogenomic and population structure analyses. The time of divergence between identified genetic lineages was estimated using a coalescent phylogenomic analysis. Palaeoecological niche modelling analyses were performed to determine areas of historical climatic suitability since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 22 ka) that potentially acted as forest refugia during the Pleistocene. A Wilcoxon test and Pearson correlations were used to explore how current levels of genetic diversity, in terms of expected heterozygosity (Hs), have been shaped by several palaeoclimatic and geographic factors. Results Phylogenomic and population structure analyses revealed two main genetic lineages with a north\textendash south distribution, which diverged 1.14 Ma during the Pleistocene. Two potential Pleistocene refugia were identified, one along the Pacific coast of Ecuador and one in the Andean foothills of south-western Ecuador. The location of these refugia agrees with the spatial location of the two genetic lineages. Within the Andean foothills, Hs was lower for the southern lineage than for the northern lineage. Hs significantly increased with decreasing latitude across the species as a whole. Main conclusions Pleistocene climatic fluctuations promoted intraspecific divergence in P. aequatorialis within the rain forests of western Ecuador. The Andean foothills of south-western Ecuador could be an important area for rain forest evolution because they potentially remained climatically suitable throughout the Pleistocene. Lower genetic diversity in the southern lineage, which apparently remained isolated in the Andean foothills during glacial cycles, adds evidence to the presence of a forest refugium in south-western Ecuador. The geographic pattern in genetic diversity suggests that P. aequatorialis colonized western Ecuador from the north. This study supports the role of Pleistocene climatic fluctuations in promoting intraspecific divergence, and for the first time, we show their impact west of the Andes.},

  abstract = {Lack of accurate and up-to-date data associated with irrigated areas and related irrigation amounts is hampering the full implementation and compliance of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). In this paper, we describe the framework that we developed and implemented within the DIANA project to map the actual extent of irrigated areas in the Campania region (Southern Italy) during the 2018 irrigation season. For this purpose, we considered 202 images from the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) products (57 images from Landsat 8 and 145 images from Sentinel-2). Such data were preprocessed in order to extract a multitemporal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) map, which was then smoothed through a gap-filling algorithm. We further integrated data coming from high-resolution (4 km) global satellite precipitation Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN)-Cloud Classification System (CCS) products. We collected an extensive ground truth in the field represented by 2992 data points coming from three main thematic classes: bare soil and rainfed (class 0), herbaceous (class 1), and tree crop (class 2). This information was exploited to generate irrigated area maps by adopting a machine learning classification approach. We compared six different types of classifiers through a cross-validation approach and found that, in general, random forests, support vector machines, and boosted decision trees exhibited the best performances in terms of classification accuracy and robustness to different tested scenarios. We found an overall accuracy close to 90\% in discriminating among the three thematic classes, which highlighted promising capabilities in the detection of irrigated areas from HLS products.},

  abstract = {Modern approaches to predictive ecosystem mapping (PEM) have not thoroughly explored the use of \&lsquo;characteristic\&rsquo; gradients, which describe vegetation structure (e.g., light detection and ranging (lidar)-derived structural profiles). In this study, we apply a PEM approach by classifying the dominant stand types within the Central Highlands region of south-eastern Australia using both lidar and species distribution models (SDMs). Similarity percentages analysis (SIMPER) was applied to comprehensive floristic surveys to identify five species which best separated stand types. The predicted distributions of these species, modelled using random forests with environmental (i.e., climate, topography) and optical characteristic gradients (Landsat-derived seasonal fractional cover), provided an ecological basis for refining stand type classifications based only on lidar-derived structural profiles. The resulting PEM model represents the first continuous distribution map of stand types across the study region that delineates ecotone stands, which are seral communities comprised of species typical of both rainforest and eucalypt forests. The spatial variability of vegetation structure incorporated into the PEM model suggests that many stand types are not as continuous in cover as represented by current ecological vegetation class distributions that describe the region. Improved PEM models can facilitate sustainable forest management, enhanced forest monitoring, and informed decision making at landscape scales.},

While these advances, combined with machine learning techniques, benefited yield modeling, most of the current literature about data-driven yield modeling has not yet accounted for potential sources of correlation in data, assuming independence between samples. In this scenario, random sampling can lead to correlated samples across sets being used for model evaluation. We implemented a spatially-aware protocol and compared it with the naive approach of assuming independence between samples. The protocols were applied through all the model development pipeline: data splitting for hold-out sets, feature selection, cross-validation for model adjustment and model evaluation. Three different machine learning techniques were used to create models in each protocol. The resulting models were evaluated both in the validation set created by each protocol and in a manually created independent set. This independent set ensured there was no auto-correlation between the samples used for modeling. We showed that assuming independence when modeling yield leads to underestimating model errors and overfit during model adjustment. Despite better error tracking, the model with the smallest error in the test set was not the model with the smallest validation error, suggesting overfit for the model selection. While this effect was small for the spatially-aware protocol, the effect was a lot stronger in the naive protocol. Future efforts in yield modeling should address the effect of spatial auto-correlation and other potential sources of correlation to improve correctness and robustness of the results.},

However, the data-scarce environment of SSA limits our understanding of the urban dynamics in the region. In this context, Earth Observation (EO) is an opportunity to gather accurate and up-to-date spatial information on urban extents. During the last decade, the adoption of open-access policies by major EO programs (CBERS, Landsat, Sentinel) has allowed the production of several global high resolution (10\textendash 30 m) maps of human settlements. However, mapping accuracies in SSA are usually lower, limited by the lack of reference datasets to support the training and the validation of the classification models. Here we propose a mapping approach based on multi-sensor satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel-1, Envisat, ERS) and volunteered geographic information (OpenStreetMap) to solve the challenges of urban remote sensing in SSA. The proposed mapping approach is assessed in 17 case studies for an average F1-score of 0.93, and applied in 45 urban areas of SSA to produce a dataset of urban expansion from 1995 to 2015. Across the case studies, built-up areas averaged a compound annual growth rate of 5.5\% between 1995 and 2015. The comparison with local population dynamics reveals the heterogeneity of urban dynamics in SSA. Overall, population densities in built-up areas are decreasing. However, the impact of population growth on urban expansion differs depending on the size of the urban area and its income class.},

We quantified and compared the effects of future climate change and four current threats (fire, habitat conversion, overgrazing and overexploitation) on the 50 most common tree species of the tropical dry forests of northwestern Peru and southern Ecuador. We used an ensemble modelling approach to predict species distribution ranges, employed freely accessible spatial datasets to map threat exposures, and developed a trait-based scoring approach to estimate species-specific sensitivities, using differentiated trait weights in accordance with their expected importance in determining species sensitivities to specific threats. Species-specific vulnerability maps were constructed from the product of the exposure maps and the sensitivity estimates. We found that all 50 species face considerable threats, with an average of 46\% of species' distribution ranges displaying high or very high vulnerability to at least one of the five threats. Our results suggest that current levels of habitat conversion, overexploitation and overgrazing pose larger threats to most of the studied species than climate change. We present a spatially explicit planning strategy for species-specific restoration and conservation actions, proposing management interventions to focus on (a) in situ conservation of tree populations and seed collection for tree planting activities in areas with low vulnerability to climate change and current threats; (b) ex situ conservation or translocation of populations in areas with high climate change vulnerability; and (c) active planting or assisted regeneration in areas under high current threat vulnerability but low climate change vulnerability, provided that interventions are in place to lower threat pressure. We provide an online, user-friendly tool to visualize both the vulnerability maps and the maps indicating priority restoration and conservation actions.},

This study aims to develop a multivariate model feasible for estimating the forage N for the growth periods (June to November) in an alpine grassland ecosystem. The random forest (RF) algorithm is employed to determine the optimum combinations of 38 spectral variables capable of capturing dynamic variations in forage N. The results show that (1) throughout the growth period, the red-edge first shifts toward longer wavelengths and then shifts toward shorter wavelengths, the amplitude (AMP) and absorption depth (AD) gradually decrease, and the absorption position (AP) changes slightly; (2) the importance of spectral variables for forage N estimation differs during the different growth periods; (3) the multivariate model achieves better results for the first four periods (June to October) than for the last period (when the grass is completely senesced) (V-R2: 0.58\&ndash;0.68 versus 0.23); and (4) for the whole growth period (June to November), the prediction accuracy of the general N estimation model validated by the unknown growth period is lower than that validated by the unknown location (V-R2 is 0.28 and 0.55 for the validation strategies of Leave-Time-Out and Leave-Location-Out, respectively). This study demonstrates that the changes in the spectral features of the red wavelength (red-edge position, AMP and AD) are well coupled with the forage N content. Moreover, the development of a multivariate RF model for estimating alpine grasslands N content during different growth periods is promising for the improvement of both the stability and accuracy of the model.},

We do this in order to investigate whether estimated generalization capabilities of learned models can be positively biased from the use of spatial features. Numerous spatial features impose homogeneity constraints on the image data, whereby a spatially connected set of image elements is attributed identical feature values. In addition to a frequent occurrence of intrinsic spatial autocorrelation, this leads to extrinsic spatial autocorrelation with respect to the image data. The first sampling scheme follows a spatially random partitioning into training and test sets. In contrast to that, the second strategy implements a spatially disjoint partitioning, which considers in particular topological constraints that arise from the deployment of spatial features. Experimental results are obtained from multi- and hyperspectral acquisitions over urban environments. They underline that a large share of the differences between estimated generalization capabilities obtained with the spatially disjoint and non-disjoint sampling strategies can be attributed to the use of spatial features, whereby differences increase with an increasing size of the spatial neighborhood considered for computing a spatial feature. This stresses the necessity of a proper spatial sampling scheme for model evaluation to avoid overoptimistic model assessments.},

  abstract = {Co-occurrence of closely related species is often explained through resource partitioning, where key morphological or life-history traits evolve under strong divergent selection. In bumble bees (genus Bombus), differences in tongue lengths, nest sites, and several life-history traits are the principal factors in resource partitioning. However, the buff-tailed and white-tailed bumble bee (Bombus terrestris and B. lucorum respectively) are very similar in morphology and life history, but their ranges nevertheless partly overlap, raising the question how they are ecologically divergent. What little is known about the environmental factors determining their distributions stems from studies in Central and Western Europe, but even less information is available about their distributions in Eastern Europe, where different subspecies occur. Here, we aimed to disentangle the broad habitat requirements and associated distributions of these species in Romania and Bulgaria. First, we genetically identified sampled individuals from many sites across the study area. We then not only computed species distributions based on presence-only data, but also expanded on these models using relative abundance data. We found that B. terrestris is a more generalist species than previously thought, but that B. lucorum is restricted to forested areas with colder and wetter climates, which in our study area are primarily found at higher elevations. Both vegetation parameters such as annual mean Leaf Area Index and canopy height, as well as climatic conditions, were important in explaining their distributions. Although our models based on presence-only data suggest a large overlap in their respective distributions, results on their relative abundance suggest that the two species replace one another across an environmental gradient correlated to elevation. The inclusion of abundance enhances our understanding of the distribution of these species, supporting the emerging recognition of the importance of abundance data in species distribution modeling.},

British Columbia, Canada, has for the past 2 decades implemented landslide risk management policies aimed at reducing the impacts of the forestry industry on landslides. Consequently, it is required that timber harvesting sites be evaluated for their potential or existing impacts on terrain stability. Statistical landslide susceptibility modelling can enhance this evaluation by geographically highlighting potential hazardous areas. In addition, these statistical models can also improve our understanding of regional landslide controlling factors. The purpose of this research was to explore the regional effects of forest harvesting activities, topography, precipitation and geology on landslides initiated during an extreme rainfall event in November 2006 on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. These effects were analyzed with a nonparametric statistical method, the generalized additive model (GAM). Although topography was the strongest predictor of landslide initiation, low density forest interpreted as regrowth areas and proximity to forest service roads were jointly associated with a 6- to 9-fold increase in the odds of landslide initiation, while accounting for other environmental confounders. This result highlights the importance of continuing proper landslide risk management to control the effects of forest practices on landslide initiation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Statistical and now machine learning prediction methods have been gaining popularity in the field of landslide susceptibility modeling. Particularly, these data driven approaches show promise when tackling the challenge of mapping landslide prone areas for large regions, which may not have sufficient geotechnical data to conduct physically-based methods. Currently, there is no best method for empirical susceptibility modeling. Therefore, this study presents a comparison of traditional statistical and novel machine learning models applied for regional scale landslide susceptibility modeling. These methods were evaluated by spatial k-fold cross-validation estimation of the predictive performance, assessment of variable importance for gaining insights into model behavior and by the appearance of the prediction (i.e. susceptibility) map. The modeling techniques applied were logistic regression (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM), weights of evidence (WOE), the support vector machine (SVM), random forest classification (RF), and bootstrap aggregated classification trees (bundling) with penalized discriminant analysis (BPLDA). These modeling methods were tested for three areas in the province of Lower Austria, Austria. The areas are characterized by different geological and morphological settings. Random forest and bundling classification techniques had the overall best predictive performances. However, the performances of all modeling techniques were for the majority not significantly different from each other; depending on the areas of interest, the overall median estimated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) differences ranged from 2.9 to 8.9 percentage points. The overall median estimated true positive rate (TPR) measured at a 10\% false positive rate (FPR) differences ranged from 11 to 15pp. The relative importance of each predictor was generally different between the modeling methods. However, slope angle, surface roughness and plan curvature were consistently highly ranked variables. The prediction methods that create splits in the predictors (RF, BPLDA and WOE) resulted in heterogeneous prediction maps full of spatial artifacts. In contrast, the GAM, GLM and SVM produced smooth prediction surfaces. Overall, it is suggested that the framework of this model evaluation approach can be applied to assist in selection of a suitable landslide susceptibility modeling technique.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) have been increasingly used over the past decades to characterise the spatial distribution and the ecological niche of various taxa. Validating predicted species distribution is important, especially when producing broad-scale models (i.e. at continental or oceanic scale) based on limited and spatially aggregated presence-only records. In the present study, several model calibration methods are compared and guidelines are provided to perform relevant SDMs using a Southern Ocean marine species, the starfish Odontaster validus Koehler, 1906, as a case study. The effect of the spatial aggregation of presence-only records on modelling performance is evaluated and the relevance of a target-background sampling procedure to correct for this effect is assessed. The accuracy of model validation is estimated using k-fold random and spatial cross-validation procedures. Finally, we evaluate the relevance of the Multivariate Environmental Similarity Surface (MESS) index to identify areas in which SDMs accurately interpolate and conversely, areas in which models extrapolate outside the environmental range of occurrence records. Results show that the random cross-validation procedure (i.e. a widely applied method, for which training and test records are randomly selected in space) tends to over-estimate model performance when applied to spatially aggregated datasets. Spatial cross-validation procedures can compensate for this over-estimation effect but different spatial cross-validation procedures must be tested for their ability to reduce over-fitting while providing relevant validation scores. Model predictions show that SDM generalisation is limited when working with aggregated datasets at broad spatial scale. The MESS index calculated in our case study show that over half of the predicted area is highly uncertain due to extrapolation. Our work provides methodological guidelines to generate accurate model assessments at broad spatial scale when using limited and aggregated presence-only datasets. We highlight the importance of taking into account the presence of spatial aggregation in species records and using non-random cross-validation procedures. Evaluating the best calibration procedures and correcting for spatial biases should be considered ahead the modelling exercise to improve modelling relevance.},

  abstract = {Predictive performance is important to many applications of species distribution models (SDMs). The SDM `ensemble' approach, which combines predictions across different modelling methods, is believed to improve predictive performance, and is used in many recent SDM studies. Here, we aim to compare the predictive performance of ensemble species distribution models to that of individual models, using a large presence\textendash absence dataset of eucalypt tree species. To test model performance, we divided our dataset into calibration and evaluation folds using two spatial blocking strategies (checkerboard-pattern and latitudinal slicing). We calibrated and cross-validated all models within the calibration folds, using both repeated random division of data (a common approach) and spatial blocking. Ensembles were built using the software package `biomod2', with standard (`untuned') settings. Boosted regression tree (BRT) models were also fitted to the same data, tuned according to published procedures. We then used evaluation folds to compare ensembles against both their component untuned individual models, and against the BRTs. We used area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) and log-likelihood for assessing model performance. In all our tests, ensemble models performed well, but not consistently better than their component untuned individual models or tuned BRTs across all tests. Moreover, choosing untuned individual models with best cross-validation performance also yielded good external performance, with blocked cross-validation proving better suited for this choice, in this study, than repeated random cross-validation. The latitudinal slice test was only possible for four species; this showed some individual models, and particularly the tuned one, performing better than ensembles. This study shows no particular benefit to using ensembles over individual tuned models. It also suggests that further robust testing of performance is required for situations where models are used to predict to distant places or environments.},

SDMs linking fossil records have the potential to improve conservation decisions under human-induced climate change. Here, we built SDMs using presence records from contemporary and Holocene records to enable estimations of climatically suitable area under current and future climate scenarios. Location Aotearoa New Zealand Taxon Tuatara, Sphenodon punctatus Methods For an evolutionary relict found in Aotearoa New Zealand, the tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus), we built SDMs using presence records from contemporary and Holocene records to estimate climatically suitable area under current and future climate scenarios. We also use our detailed knowledge of the Holocene distribution and remnant populations to examine niche shifts following the arrival of humans and associated introduction of mammalian predators. To build SDMs, we use presence records from four sources: (a) remnant populations, (b) radiocarbon-dated fossil deposits from the Holocene, (c) other fossil deposits containing tuatara bones of Holocene age and iv) islands from which tuatara are known or highly likely to have become extinct. Results We found shifts in the niche of tuatara due to niche unfilling. Incorporating locations of Holocene deposits and/or all past locations in SDMs led to larger areas of climatically suitable area being identified compared to SDMs derived from remnant populations only. Using all presence records, under climate change projections for 2090, climatically suitable area increased slightly. However, many areas retain potential as translocation sites (e.g. northern South Island), some areas become unsuitable (e.g. inland Canterbury) and/or involve extrapolation into novel climates (e.g. Northland). Main Conclusion SDMs incorporating locations of Holocene deposits and/or all past locations identified areas of critical habitat for tuatara under current and future climate scenarios, that would not have been identified using contemporary occurrences only. Our results highlight the need to consider past locations when assessing habitat suitability for conservation translocations, both for tuatara and other relict species.},

  abstract = {Against the backdrop of rapidly expanding urban structures, land policies in many countries have been adapted to contain and redirect growth to existing urban structures. However, obstacles remain to measure the effects of policies. In the meantime, geoinformation technologies have given rise to a wide range of approaches to measure and describe urban form. Nevertheless, its application for the assessment of land policy has a high, but not yet fully exploited, potential. It is thus the aim of this research to address and investigate the options of spatial analysis and machine learning in particular to analyse urban form from a land policy perspective. To do so, we develop urban metrics informed by urban planning and land readjustment policies of two countries describing urban form on different spatial levels. We therefore formulate hypotheses on causal relations between policy and form. Based on the metrics, we apply the random forest algorithm to classify the building stock of the region. We then extract the residential areas, those with single-family houses, as this is where the effects of the policy are considered most visible. In a next step, we use random forest to predict the nationality of a building. Through variable importance measures, we identify and discuss urban morphological differences between the two countries and test the hypotheses on effects of land policies. We develop and test the approach for the French-German city-region of Strasbourg using OpenStreetMap data. We identify significant differences in the building coverage ratios, which tend to be higher in Germany. This can be linked to differences in planning regulations. Furthermore, German residential areas appear to be more diverse in urban form. Differences in land readjustment policies have proven to be plausible here, as French policies favour strong actors that develop residential areas more uniformly. In Germany, policies favour fragmented ownership-oriented development of residential areas. The metrics and the applied algorithm for building classification have proven to be robust in terms of data heterogeneity and have shown high levels of accuracy. They could also be successfully used for tracing causal relations.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem restoration is regarded as one of the most cost-effective ways of mitigating the effects of the ongoing climate- and anthropogenic changes and slow or revert the loss of biodiversity. Forest restoration has much potential to conserve forest specialist species and ecosystem services, by using multiple, native tree species to promote a high local diversity of trees, with likely positive effects on overall biodiversity and on ecosystem resilience. In this study, we assessed the potential of using two rare, native species of the yew family (Taxaceae) in forest restoration in China. Species of this family are only rarely used in reforestation despite their potential contribution to tree functional diversity as long-lived, shade-tolerant, evergreen understory trees with fleshy seed cones of value to frugivorous animals. By using species distribution modelling methods, we analysed national and local scale occurrence data for Taxus cuspidata and Torreya grandis to determine the climate-based potential ranges as well as important factors for growth on a local scale. The analyses showed that both species have large potential ranges driven mainly by precipitation and by comparing these ranges with the areas that have potential for sustaining forests, we found large areas available for forest restoration where these species could be included. On the local scale, we found that low light levels and low competition from co-occurring trees are more important for the growth of seedlings compared to the adult individuals of both species. If the ecological requirements for seedlings are ensured, i.e. by creating moderately shaded environments in which seedlings can escape competition, both Taxaceae species have high potential for reforestation in China and will increase the ecological qualities of a restored forest, and at the same time, the conservation of rare tree-species in their native ranges is ensured. Conclusively, both Ta. cuspidata and To. grandis are shade-tolerant, slow-growing trees that, by creating an evergreen scrubby layer, add to forest structural complexity and stability, thereby helping support ecosystem services and biodiversity, e.g. microhabitat and resources for birds and other animals.},

This property can help to improve the classification performance, by adding spatial or contextual features into the model. However, it can also lead to overestimation of generalisation capabilities, if the spatial dependence between training and test sets is ignored. In this paper, we review existing approaches that deal with spatial autocorrelation for image classification in remote sensing and demonstrate the importance of bias in accuracy metrics when spatial independence between the training and test sets is not respected. We compare three spatial and non-spatial cross-validation strategies at pixel and object levels and study how performances vary at different sample sizes. Experiments based on Sentinel-2 data for mapping two simple forest classes show that spatial leave-one-out cross-validation is the better strategy to provide unbiased estimates of predictive error. Its performance metrics are consistent with the real quality of the resulting map contrary to traditional non-spatial cross-validation that overestimates accuracy. This highlight the need to change practices in classification accuracy assessment. To encourage it we developped Museo ToolBox, an open-source python library that makes spatial cross-validation possible.},

Understanding temporal and spatial variability of inundation patterns is critical for optimum resource management, particularly in striking an appropriate balance between environmental water application and extractive use. Nevertheless, quantifying inundation at the fine resolution required of ecological modeling is an immense challenge in these environments. In this study, Random Forest, a machine learning technique, was implemented to predict the inundation pattern in a section of the Darling River Floodplain, Australia, at a spatial scale of 30 m and daily temporal resolution. The model achieved very good performance with an average accuracy of 0.915 based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve over 10 runs of the model in testing data sets. Six variables explained 70\% of the total contribution to inundation occurrence, with the most influential being landscape shape (local deviation from global mean elevation), elevation-weighted distance to the river, the magnitude of river flow (10- and 30-day accumulated river discharge), local rainfall, and soil moisture. This approach is applicable to other floodplains across the world where understanding of fine-scale inundation pattern is for operational ecological management and scenario testing.},

As a prerequisite for testing passive microwave algorithm estimations of SWE, this study aims to collect snow depth (SD) data and provide an understanding of its complex spatial structure as part of the Canadian International Polar Year observations theme. Snow accumulation, redistribution and ablation are controlled by processes that depend on a variety of topographic factors as well as land surface characteristics, which leads us to modelling SD as a function of proxy variables derived from digital elevation model and Landsat data. Field measurements were performed at 3924 locations compromising 184 sites in 50 transects over 2 years. These measurements were used to predict SD over the study area using a spatial linear mixed-effects model, a model type capable of handling the hierarchical structure of the field data. The model, built using stepwise variable selection, uses as predictor variables transformed elevation, slope, the logarithm of slope, potential incoming solar radiation and its transform; the normalized difference vegetation index, and a transformed tasseled cap brightness from Landsat imagery. A second, simpler model links SD with density giving SWE. The cross-validated root mean squared error of the SD distribution model was 14 cm around an overall mean of 80 cm over a domain of 250 \texttimes{} 250 km. This instantaneous end-of-season peak-accumulation snow map will enable the validation of satellite remote sensing over a generally inaccessible area.

First, we evaluate each model\&rsquo;s performance in the spatial prediction of AOD, and we additionally consider ensemble methods for combining the predictors. In order to accurately assess the predictive performance of these methods, we construct spatially clustered holdouts to mimic the observed patterns of missing data.

Our results suggest that ensemble methods of combining lattice kriging and random forest can improve AOD gap-filling.

  abstract = {Crop type information such as its location and spatial distribution is relevant for agricultural planning and decision making about food sustainability and security. This information can be obtained through the analysis of images obtained through optical satellite remote sensing. Activities such as accurate discrimination of crops require dense time-series of satellite data which can capture the diverse crop phenology. However, given the presence of clouds at important periods of crops' development, the required time-series is impossible to obtain from just one optical satellite sensor. The Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) project by NASA provides fused data from both Operational Land Imager and Multispectral Instrument optical sensors of Landsat and Sentinel systems respectively. The present study used a multi-temporal HLS data and a target-oriented cross-validation (TOV) modelling approach with random forest algorithm to discriminate 13 crop types. 15 phenological metrics derived from time-series HLS data, together with 48 spectral and 2 topographic information were used as predictors in the model. A forward feature selection (FFS) procedure of the TOV was used to improve the classification model. 16 predictors comprising of spectral, phenological and topographic information were selected as useful for the crop discrimination. An independent accuracy assessment of the final model based on the selected predictors by the FFS procedure resulted in an overall accuracy of 76\%. While most of the crop classes, achieved higher producer's and user's accuracies ({$>$}80\%), the discrimination accuracies of potato, summer oat and winter triticale were comparatively low ({$<$}60\%). Based on the outcome of the FFS, three models consisting of different predictor combinations, were further developed to ascertain the contribution of the predictors. A comparison of the models showed that the addition of phenological metrics increased the discrimination performance of the model as a whole and for cereals in particular. However, the inclusion of the topographic information did not have any significant effect on the overall model performance. Therefore, future crop type discrimination research in areas with similar terrain characteristics like Northern Hesse should reconsider the use of topographic predictors. Overall, our findings depict that the TOV modelling approach based on multi-temporal and multi-sensor data is promising for effective, accurate and practical crop type discrimination.},

In this context, this study aims to characterize the changes over farming systems through trend analysis. To this end, four farming systems (fallow, rainfed, irrigated annual, and irrigated perennial) in arid areas of Morocco were studied based on four phenological metrics (PhM) (i.e., great integral, start, end, and length of the season). These were derived from large Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series using both a machine learning algorithm and a pixel-based change analysis method. Results showed that during the last twenty-year period (i.e., 2000\textendash 2019), a significant dynamism of the plant cover was linked to the behavior of farmers who tend to cultivate intensively and to invest in high-income crops. More specifically, a relevant variability in fallow and rainfed areas, closely linked to the weather conditions, was found. In addition, significant lag trends of the start (-6 days) and end (+3 days) were found, which indicate that the length of the season was related to the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall. This study has also highlighted the potential of multitemporal moderate spatial resolution data to accurately monitor agriculture and better manage land resources. In the meantime, for operationally implementing the use of such work in the field, we believe that it is essential consider the perceptions, opinions, and mutual benefits of farmers and stakeholders to improve strategies and synergies whilst ensuring food, welfare, and sustainability.},

  abstract = {One of the best preconditions for the sufficient monitoring of peat bog ecosystems is the collection, processing, and analysis of unique spatial data to understand peat bog dynamics. Over two seasons, we sampled groundwater level (GWL) and soil moisture (SM) ground truth data at two diverse locations at the Rokytka Peat bog within the Sumava Mountains, Czechia. These data served as reference data and were modeled with a suite of potential variables derived from digital surface models (DSMs) and RGB, multispectral, and thermal orthoimages reflecting topomorphometry, vegetation, and surface temperature information generated from drone mapping. We used 34 predictors to feed the random forest (RF) algorithm. The predictor selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance assessment were performed with the target-oriented leave-location-out (LLO) spatial cross-validation (CV) strategy combined with forward feature selection (FFS) to avoid overfitting and to predict on unknown locations. The spatial CV performance statistics showed low (R2 = 0.12) to high (R2 = 0.78) model predictions. The predictor importance was used for model interpretation, where temperature had strong impact on GWL and SM, and we found significant contributions of other predictors, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Index (NDI), Enhanced Red-Green-Blue Vegetation Index (ERGBVE), Shape Index (SHP), Green Leaf Index (GLI), Brightness Index (BI), Coloration Index (CI), Redness Index (RI), Primary Colours Hue Index (HI), Overall Hue Index (HUE), SAGA Wetness Index (TWI), Plan Curvature (PlnCurv), Topographic Position Index (TPI), and Vector Ruggedness Measure (VRM). Additionally, we estimated the area of applicability (AOA) by presenting maps where the prediction model yielded high-quality results and where predictions were highly uncertain because machine learning (ML) models make predictions far beyond sampling locations without sampling data with no knowledge about these environments. The AOA method is well suited and unique for planning and decision-making about the best sampling strategy, most notably with limited data.},

However the drivers of bush encroachment are not yet fully revealed which can partly be attributed to the problem that large-scale data of woody vegetation cover are missing. Using a multi-scale and a multi-sensor approach, this study aimed at providing the status of woody vegetation cover for the Molopo Area in South Africa. Training data for woody vegetation was derived from unsupervised classification of high-resolution aerial image tiles. To derive spatially continuous estimates of fractional woody cover for the entire Molopo Area, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data were applied in a machine learning based modelling approach. Therefore, a database of training samples was generated by aggregating the classified aerial image tiles to the geometry of the Sentinel data. A Random Forest algorithm with a forward feature variable selection was then trained to relate the spectral and radar information to fractional woody cover. The model was applied to make spatial predictions of fractional woody cover at 10 m resolution for the entire Molopo Area for the year 2016. Spatial cross-validation revealed a prediction error in fractional cover of 12\%. The derived model and cover data show the potential for upcoming time series analysis of Sentinel-based woody cover estimates which can serve as a basis to bring new insights into the drivers of bush encroachment.},

The question we address here is whether such crowd-sourced data contain substantial macroecological information. In particular, we aim to understand if we can detect known environmental gradients shaping plant co-occurrences. In this study we analysed 1 million data points collected through the use of the mobile app Flora Incognita between 2018 and 2019 in Germany and compared them with Florkart, containing plant occurrence data collected by more than 5000 floristic experts over a 70-year period. The direct comparison of the two data sets reveals that the crowd-sourced data particularly undersample areas of low population density. However, using nonlinear dimensionality reduction we were able to uncover macroecological patterns in both data sets that correspond well to each other. Mean annual temperature, temperature seasonality and wind dynamics as well as soil water content and soil texture represent the most important gradients shaping species composition in both data collections. Our analysis describes one way of how automated species identification could soon enable near real-time monitoring of macroecological patterns and their changes, but also discusses biases that must be carefully considered before crowd-sourced biodiversity data can effectively guide conservation measures.},

The inventory, which does not originally belong to this study, was revised by the authors in order to obtain a database suitable for statistical modelling. Climatic and topographic data evaluated at the rock glacier locations were used as predictor variables in a Generalized Linear Model. Model performances are strong, suggesting that, in agreement with several previous studies, this methodology is able to model accurately rock glacier distribution. A methodology to estimate model uncertainties is proposed, revealing that the subjectivity in the interpretation of rock glacier activity and contours may substantially bias the model. The model highlights a North-South trend in the regional pattern of permafrost distribution which is attributed to the climatic influences of the Atlantic and Mediterranean climates. Further analysis suggest that lower amounts of precipitation in the early winter and a thinner snow cover, as typically found in the Mediterranean area, could contribute to the existence of permafrost at higher temperatures compared to the Northern Alps. A comparison with the Alpine Permafrost Index Map (APIM) shows no major differences with our model, highlighting the very good predictive power of the APIM despite its tendency to slightly overestimate permafrost extension with respect to our database. The use of rock glaciers as indicators of permafrost existence despite their time response to climate change is discussed and an interpretation key is proposed in order to ensure the proper use of the model for research as well as for operational purposes.},

  abstract = {A growing number of investigations have shown that remote sensing of foliar nitrogen (N) concentration in plant canopies can be achieved with imaging spectroscopy, or hyperspectral remote sensing, from satellite or airborne sensors. Development of this approach has been fueled by recognition that foliar N is related to a variety of ecological and biogeochemical processes, ranging from the spread of invasive species to the ecosystem effects of insect defoliation events to patterns of N cycling in forest soils. To date, most studies have focused on building site-specific foliar N detection algorithms applied to individual scenes or small landscapes that have been intensively characterized with local field measurements. However, the growing number of well-measured sites, combined with improvements in image data quality and processing methods provide an opportunity to begin seeking more general N detection methods that can be applied to a broader range of sites or to locations that lack intensive field measurements. Here, we combine data from several independent efforts in North America, Central America and Australia, to examine whether development of calibration methods to determine canopy nitrogen concentration across a wide range of forest ecosystems is possible. The analysis included data from 137 individual field plots within eight study sites for which imagery has been acquired from NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and/or Hyperion instruments. The combined dataset was used to evaluate site-specific calibration results as well as results obtained with data pooled across all sites. We evaluated the accuracy of results using plot- and site-level cross-validation wherein individual plots or entire sites were withheld and used as an independent validation of the resulting algorithms. In instances where all sites were represented in the calibration, canopy-level foliar N concentration was predicted to within 7\textendash 15\% of the mean field-measured values indicating a strong potential for broadly applied foliar N detection. When whole sites were iteratively dropped from the calibration and predicted by remaining data, predictions were still significant, but less accurate (7\textendash 47\% of mean canopy-level N concentration). This suggests that further development to include a wider range of ecosystems will be necessary before cross-site prediction accuracy approaches that seen in site-specific calibrations. Nevertheless, we view these results as promising, particularly given the potential value of foliar N estimates, even at a reduced level of confidence, at sites for which there is no possibility of conducting field data collections.},

We compared tree cover to summer land surface temperature, as measured using Landsat imagery. In 92\% of the urbanized areas surveyed, low-income blocks have less tree cover than high-income blocks. On average, low-income blocks have 15.2\% less tree cover and are 1.5{$^0$}C hotter than high-income blocks. The greatest difference between low- and high-income blocks was found in urbanized areas in the Northeast of the United States, where low-income blocks in some urbanized areas have 30\% less tree cover and are 4.0{$^0$}C hotter. Even after controlling for population density and built-up intensity, the positive association between income and tree cover is significant, as is the positive association between proportion non-Hispanic white and tree cover. We estimate, after controlling for population density, that low-income blocks have 62 million fewer trees than high-income blocks, equal to a compensatory value of \$56 billion (\$1,349/person). An investment in tree planting and natural regeneration of \$17.6 billion would be needed to close the tree cover disparity, benefitting 42 million people in low-income blocks.},

An increasing number of studies have used machine learning models based on land use data as an efficient means for mapping land suitability. This approach relies on the assumption that farmers grow their crops in the best-suited areas, but no studies have systematically tested this assumption. We aimed to test the assumption for specialty crops in Denmark. First, we mapped suitability for 41 specialty crops using machine learning. Then, we compared the predicted land suitabilities with the mechanistic model ECOCROP (Ecological Crop Requirements). The results showed that there was little agreement between the suitabilities based on machine learning and ECOCROP. Therefore, we argue that the methods represent different phenomena, which we label as socioeconomic suitability and ecological suitability, respectively. In most cases, machine learning predicts socioeconomic suitability, but the ambiguity of the term land suitability can lead to misinterpretation. Therefore, we highlight the need for increasing awareness of this distinction as a way forward for agricultural land suitability assessment.},

  abstract = {Questions El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a strong driver of climatic and ecosystem variability in coastal NW Peru. La Ni\~na amplifies the already dry local conditions, and led to depleted ecosystems in 2011. However, the 2012 La Ni\~na event triggered rainfall far above the average. (1) Did plant species diversity, primary productivity and vegetation assemblages change along a climatic gradient between two climatologically different La Ni\~na years; (2) Is there a difference in explanatory power of environmental predictors between the 2 yr; and (iii) is it possible to predict the observed vegetation patterns spatially? Location Transect along a climatic gradient in the Sechura Desert of Piura, NW Peru (corresponds to the terrestrial part of the El Ni\~no region 1 + 2) \textendash{} a region of extremely high climatic variability. Methods We visited 50 30 m \texttimes{} 30 m randomly sampled plots in 2011 and 2012. A Procrustes analysis of two non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordinations provided information on the temporal change of species assemblages. Variation partitioning revealed the differences in explanatory power of the predictors. We employed a generalized additive model (GAM) to fit the scores of the first ordination axis with a floristic gradient map as a result. Results Generally, higher rainfall resulted in a positive feedback when considering biodiversity, productivity and vegetation assemblages. The floristic gradient map resulting from the GAM displayed the spatial distribution of the three main assemblages along the climatic gradient. Edaphic variables added no independent portion to the explanation of the vegetation assemblages, but explained in conjunction with topography and NDVI a considerable amount of the variance. Conclusions Strong Atlantic easterly winds crossing the Andes can boost plant growth even during a La Ni\~na situation. This underscores the need for a deeper understanding of ENSO-related climate variability of ENSO. Combining vegetation maps with accurate predictions of such climatic anomalies would aid the effective execution of conservation and recovery strategies. Additionally, coupling an unconstrained ordination with a GAM appears to be a promising tool for vegetation mapping, especially in the presence of a non-linear gradient.},

  abstract = {The tropical dry forests of NW Peru are heavily shaped by the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO), where especially El Ni\~no brings rain to arid to semi-arid areas. However, the resulting effects on biodiversity patterns remain largely unknown as well as the effect of environmental variables on the floristic composition under varying rainfall patterns. Therefore, we studied the spatio-temporal effects of different ENSO episodes on floristic biodiversity along a climatic gradient ranging from the coastal desert to the Andean foothills. We sampled 50 vegetation plots in four years representing different ENSO episodes. To highlight the spatio-temporal changes in floristic composition and beta diversity across ENSO episodes, we predicted ordination scores with a Generalized Additive Model. We applied variation partitioning to test if topographic or edaphic variables gained in importance during more humid ENSO episodes. Additionally, we executed an irrigation\textendash fertilization experiment to quantify the beneficial effects of the water\textendash nutrient interaction under different simulated ENSO rainfall scenarios. Plant species richness increased under humid conditions during the humid La Ni\~na (2012) and the moderate El Ni\~no (2016), and slightly decreased under the very humid conditions during the coastal El Ni\~no (2017). The spatial prediction revealed that specific vegetation formations became more pronounced with increasing water input, but that a large water surplus led to the disruption of the strict order along the climatic gradient. Edaphic and topographic variables gained in importance with increased water availability (2012 and 2016), however, this effect was not further amplified under very wet conditions (2017). The experiment showed that plant cover under Super Ni\~no conditions was three times higher when fertilized. Overall, our spatial predictions concede detailed insights into spatio-temporal ecosystem dynamics in response to varying rainfall caused by different ENSO episodes while the results of the experiment can support farmers regarding a sustainable agrarian management.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated a need for increased rigour in building and evaluating ecological niche models (ENMs) based on presence-only occurrence data. Two major goals are to balance goodness-of-fit with model complexity (e.g. by `tuning' model settings) and to evaluate models with spatially independent data. These issues are especially critical for data sets suffering from sampling bias, and for studies that require transferring models across space or time (e.g. responses to climate change or spread of invasive species). Efficient implementation of procedures to accomplish these goals, however, requires automation. We developed ENMeval, an R package that: (i) creates data sets for k-fold cross-validation using one of several methods for partitioning occurrence data (including options for spatially independent partitions), (ii) builds a series of candidate models using Maxent with a variety of user-defined settings and (iii) provides multiple evaluation metrics to aid in selecting optimal model settings. The six methods for partitioning data are n-1 jackknife, random k-folds ( = bins), user-specified folds and three methods of masked geographically structured folds. ENMeval quantifies six evaluation metrics: the area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristic plot for test localities (AUCTEST), the difference between training and testing AUC (AUCDIFF), two different threshold-based omission rates for test localities and the Akaike information criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc). We demonstrate ENMeval by tuning model settings for eight tree species of the genus Coccoloba in Puerto Rico based on AICc. Evaluation metrics varied substantially across model settings, and models selected with AICc differed from default ones. In summary, ENMeval facilitates the production of better ENMs and should promote future methodological research on many outstanding issues.},

  abstract = {Indoor radon is considered as an indoor air pollutant due to its carcinogenic effect. Since the main source of indoor radon is the ground beneath the house, we utilize the geogenic radon potential (GRP) and a geogenic radon hazard index (GRHI) for predicting the geogenic component of the indoor Rn hazard in Germany. For this purpose, we link indoor radon data (n~=~44,629) to maps of GRP and GRHI and fit logistic regression models to calculate the probabilities that indoor Rn exceeds thresholds of 100~Bq/m3 and 300~Bq/m3. The estimated probability was averaged for every municipality by considering only the estimates within the built-up area. Finally, the mean exceedance probability per municipality was coupled with the respective residential building stock for estimating the number of buildings with indoor Rn above 100~Bq/m3 and 300~Bq/m3 for each municipality. We found that (1) GRHI is a better predictor than GRP for indoor radon hazard in Germany, (2) the estimated number of buildings above 100~Bq/m3 and 300~Bq/m3 in Germany is \textasciitilde 2 million (11.6\% of all residential buildings) and~\textasciitilde ~350,000 (1.9\%), respectively, (3) areas where 300~Bq/m3 exceedance is greater than 10\% comprise only 0.8\% of the German building stock but 6.3\% of buildings with indoor Rn exceeding 300~Bq/m3, and (4) most urban areas and, hence, most buildings (77\%) are located in low hazard regions. The implications for Rn protection are twofold: (1) the Rn priority area concept is cost-efficient in a sense that it allows to find the most buildings that exceed a threshold concentration with a given amount of resources, and (2) for an optimal reduction of lung cancer risk areas outside of Rn priority areas must be addressed since most hazardous indoor Rn concentrations occur in low to medium hazard areas.},

As more and more national and provincial authorities demand for these maps to be computed and implemented in spatial planning strategies, several aspects of the quality of the landslide susceptibility model and the resulting classified map are of high interest. In this study of landslides in Lower Austria, we focus on the model form uncertainty to assess the quality of a flexible statistical modelling technique, the generalized additive model (GAM). The study area (15 850 km\textsuperscript{2}) is divided into 16 modelling domains based on lithology classes. A model representing the entire study area is constructed by combining these models. The performances of the models are assessed using repeated \emph{k}-fold cross-validation with spatial and random subsampling. This reflects the variability of performance estimates arising from sampling variation. Measures of spatial transferability and thematic consistency are applied to empirically assess model quality. We also analyse and visualize the implications of spatially varying prediction uncertainties regarding the susceptibility map classes by taking into account the confidence intervals of model predictions. The 95\% confidence limits fall within the same susceptibility class in 85\% of the study area. Overall, this study contributes to advancing open communication and assessment of model quality related to statistical landslide susceptibility models.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, current large-scale maps show strong disparities, despite good validation statistics of their underlying models. Here, we attribute this contradiction to a flaw in the validation methods, which ignore spatial autocorrelation (SAC) in data, leading to overoptimistic assessment of model predictive power. To illustrate this issue, we reproduce the approach of large-scale mapping studies using a massive forest inventory dataset of 11.8 million trees in central Africa to train and validate a random forest model based on multispectral and environmental variables. A standard nonspatial validation method suggests that the model predicts more than half of the forest biomass variation, while spatial validation methods accounting for SAC reveal quasi-null predictive power. This study underscores how a common practice in big data mapping studies shows an apparent high predictive power, even when predictors have poor relationships with the ecological variable of interest, thus possibly leading to erroneous maps and interpretations.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses different feature selection methods and CO2 flux data sets with a varying quality-quantity balance for the application of a Random Forest model to predict daily CO2 fluxes at 250 m spatial resolution for the Rur catchment area in western Germany between 2010 and 2018. Measurements from eddy covariance stations of different ecosystem types, remotely sensed vegetation data from MODIS, and COSMO-REA6 reanalysis data were used to train the model and predictions were validated by a spatial and temporal validation scheme. Results show the capabilities of a backwards feature elimination to remove irrelevant variables and an importance of high-quality-low-quantity flux data set to improve predictions. However, results also show that spatial prediction is more difficult than temporal prediction by reflecting the mean value accurately though underestimating the variance of CO2 fluxes. Vegetated parts of the catchment acted as a CO2 sink during the investigation period, net capturing about 237 g C m-2 y-1. Croplands, coniferous forests, deciduous forests and grasslands were all sinks on average. The highest uptake was predicted to occur in late spring and early summer, while the catchment was a CO2 source in fall and winter. In conclusion, the Random Forest model predicted a narrower distribution of CO2 fluxes, though our methodological improvements look promising in order to achieve high-resolution net ecosystem exchange data sets at the regional scale.},

  abstract = {Aim Processes and variables measured in ecology are almost always spatially autocorrelated, potentially leading to the choice of overly complex models when performing variable selection. One way to solve this problem is to account for residual spatial autocorrelation (RSA) for each subset of variables considered and then use a classical model selection criterion such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC). However, this method can be laborious and it raises other concerns such as which spatial model to use or how to compare different spatial models. To improve the accuracy of variable selection in ecology, this study evaluates an alternative method based on a spatial cross-validation procedure. Such a procedure is usually used for model evaluation but can also provide interesting outcomes for variable selection in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Innovation We propose to use a special case of spatial cross-validation, spatial leave-one-out (SLOO), giving a criterion equivalent to the AIC in the absence of spatial autocorrelation. SLOO only computes non-spatial models and uses a threshold distance (equal to the range of RSA) to keep each point left out spatially independent from the others. We first provide some simulations to evaluate how SLOO performs compared with AIC. We then assess the robustness of SLOO on a large-scale dataset. R software codes are provided for generalized linear models. Main conclusions The AIC was relevant for variable selection in the presence of RSA if the independent variables considered were not spatially autocorrelated. It otherwise failed because highly spatially autocorrelated variables were more often selected than others. Conversely, SLOO had similar performances whether the variables were themselves spatially autocorrelated or not. It was particularly useful when the range of RSA was small, which is a common property of spatial tools. SLOO appears to be a promising solution for selecting relevant variables from most ecological spatial datasets.},

  abstract = {Precision Agriculture is the application of state-of-the-art GPS technology in connection with site-specific, sensor-based treatment of the crop. It can also be described as a data-driven approach to agriculture, which is strongly connected with a number of data mining problems. One of those is also an inherently important task in agriculture: yield prediction. The question is: can a field's yield be predicted in-season using available geo-coded data sets?In the past, a number of approaches have been proposed towards this problem. Often, a broad variety of regression models for non-spatial data have been used, like regression trees, neural networks and support vector machines. But in a cross-validation learning approach, issues with the assumption of the data records' statistical independence keep emerging. Hence, the geographical location of data records should clearly be considered while establishing a regression model and assessing its predictive performance. This paper gives a short overview of the available data, points out in detail the main issue with the classical learning approaches and presents a novel spatial cross-validation technique to overcome the problems with the classical approach towards the aforementioned yield prediction task.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are efficient tools for modeling species geographic distribution under climate change scenarios. Due to differences among predictions of these models, their results are combined using consensus methods to form an ensemble model. This paper provides an optimal combination of the common SDMs according to accuracy and correlation to model the climatic suitability of Quercus brantii in the west of Iran and projects it into the years 2050 and 2070. This is done using 1000 samples of the species presence and absence, 4 bioclimatic variables related to temperature and precipitation, and 10 modeling algorithms. An ensemble combination of Global Climate Models (GCMs) and 4 optimistic and pessimistic greenhouse-gas emissions scenarios were utilized to identify the climatically suitable areas in the years 2050 and 2070. These models were combined using three common statistics, including mean, median, and weighted mean. The predictive accuracies of the single-models and the consensus methods were assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) metric that validates the acceptable performance of the 9 out of the 10 models studied. Applying the genetic algorithm, the best combination of the models was selected including 4 algorithms with accuracy and correlation equal 0.95 and 0.30 respectively. The results show that the Random Forest (RF) model causes less error in the ensemble model and also compensates other models' errors more. Projections into the years 2050 and 2070 showed that in both time periods and under all scenarios, changes will occur in the spatial distribution of this species, and the most severe one would be a 55.6\% loss under the most pessimistic scenario in 2070.},

  abstract = {For many decades, kriging and deterministic interpolation techniques, such as inverse distance weighting and nearest neighbour interpolation, have been the most popular spatial interpolation techniques. Kriging with external drift and regression kriging have become basic techniques that benefit both from spatial autocorrelation and covariate information. More recently, machine learning techniques, such as random forest and gradient boosting, have become increasingly popular and are now often used for spatial interpolation. Some attempts have been made to explicitly take the spatial component into account in machine learning, but so far, none of these approaches have taken the natural route of incorporating the nearest observations and their distances to the prediction location as covariates. In this research, we explored the value of including observations at the nearest locations and their distances from the prediction location by introducing Random Forest Spatial Interpolation (RFSI). We compared RFSI with deterministic interpolation methods, ordinary kriging, regression kriging, Random Forest and Random Forest for spatial prediction (RFsp) in three case studies. The first case study made use of synthetic data, i.e., simulations from normally distributed stationary random fields with a known semivariogram, for which ordinary kriging is known to be optimal. The second and third case studies evaluated the performance of the various interpolation methods using daily precipitation data for the 2016\&ndash;2018 period in Catalonia, Spain, and mean daily temperature for the year 2008 in Croatia. Results of the synthetic case study showed that RFSI outperformed most simple deterministic interpolation techniques and had similar performance as inverse distance weighting and RFsp. As expected, kriging was the most accurate technique in the synthetic case study. In the precipitation and temperature case studies, RFSI mostly outperformed regression kriging, inverse distance weighting, random forest, and RFsp. Moreover, RFSI was substantially faster than RFsp, particularly when the training dataset was large and high-resolution prediction maps were made.},

We used Martu (Aboriginal people of the Australian western deserts) occurrence knowledge and presence data from track-based surveys to create predictive species distribution models with the Maxent program. Predictions of species distribution based on Martu knowledge were broader than those created with survey data. Together the Martu and survey models showed potential local declines, which were supported by Martu observation. Both data types were influenced by sampling bias that appeared to affect model predictions and performance. Martu provided additional information on habitat associations and locations of decline and descriptions of the ecosystem dynamics and disturbance regimes that influence occupancy. We concluded that intercultural approaches that draw on multiple sources of knowledge and information types may improve species distribution modeling and inform management of threatened or culturally significant species.},

Current understanding of the spatial distribution of sedimentary C across continental shelves remains poor, inhibiting the targeted management and potential inclusion of these globally significant C stores into national C budgets. Further understanding of the spatial heterogeneity of continental shelf sediments and associated C provides a foundation to quantify the organic carbon (OC) stock and better understand the role that marine sediments play in regulating the global climate and the potential for CO2 to be released through anthropogenic disturbance of these C stores. Utilizing a spectrum of available marine data, we have created bespoke sediment maps that quantify the surficial (top 10 cm) OC stock and highlight significant spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of sediments and their associated C content across the United Kingdom's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The surficial sediments within the UK EEZ are estimated to store 524 {$\pm$} 68 Mt of organic carbon (OC) and 2,582 {$\pm$} 168 Mt of inorganic carbon (IC). The spatial mapping of this C highlights well-defined OC accumulation hotspots in fjords, estuaries and coastal muds, while large accumulations of IC are found in the tidally swept areas around Orkney, Shetland and the South West of England. Within the well-defined OC hotspots, muddy sediments store the greatest quantity of OC; the muds offer potentially valuable opportunities for targeted future management and protection of sedimentary C stores within the UK EEZ. In the future, if areas of the seafloor were to be managed to include the protection of these valuable sedimentary C resources, we recommend an initial focus on hotspots of high sedimentary OC density.},

  abstract = {Data-driven landslide susceptibility models formally integrate spatial landslide information with explanatory environmental variables that describe predisposing factors of slope instability. Well-performing models are commonly utilized to identify landslide-prone terrain or to understand the causes of slope instability. In most cases, however, the available landslide data is affected by spatial biases (e.g. underrepresentation of landslides far from infrastructure or in forests) and does therefore not perfectly represent the spatial distribution of past slope instabilities. Literature shows that implications of such data flaws are frequently ignored. This study was built upon landslide information that systematically relates to damage-causing and infrastructure-threatening events in South Tyrol, Italy (7400~km2). The created models represent three conceptually different strategies to deal with biased landslide information. The aims were to demonstrate why an inference of geomorphic causation from apparently well-performing models is invalid under common landslide data bias conditions (Model 1), to test a novel bias-adjustment approach (Model 2) and to exploit the underlying data bias to model areas likely affected by potentially damaging landslides (Model 3; intervention index), instead of landslide susceptibility. The study offers a novel perspective on how biases in landslide data can be considered within data-driven models by focusing not only on the process under investigation (landsliding), but also on the circumstances that led to the registration of landslide information (data collection effects). The results were evaluated in terms of statistical relationships, variable importance, predictive performance, and geomorphic plausibility. The results revealed that none of the models reflected landslide susceptibility. Despite partly high predictive performances, the models were unable to create geomorphically plausible spatial predictions. The impact-oriented intervention index, however, enabled to identify damage-causing landslides with high accuracy. We conclude that the frequent practice of inferring geomorphic causation from well-performing models without accounting for data limitations is invalid.},

  abstract = {Extreme weather can have significant impacts on plant species demography; however, most studies have focused on responses to a single or small number of extreme events. Long-term patterns in climate extremes, and how they have shaped contemporary distributions, have rarely been considered or tested. BIOCLIM variables that are commonly used in correlative species distribution modelling studies cannot be used to quantify climate extremes, as they are generated using long-term averages and therefore do not describe year-to-year, temporal variability. We evaluated the response of 37 plant species to base climate (long-term means, equivalent to BIOCLIM variables), variability (standard deviations) and extremes of varying return intervals (defined using quantiles) based on historical observations. These variables were generated using fine-grain (approx. 250 m), time-series temperature and precipitation data for the hottest, coldest and driest months over 39 years. Extremes provided significant additive improvements in model performance compared to base climate alone and were more consistent than variability across all species. Models that included extremes frequently showed notably different mapped predictions relative to those using base climate alone, despite often small differences in statistical performance as measured as a summary across sites. These differences in spatial patterns were most pronounced at the predicted range margins, and reflect the influence of coastal proximity, continentality, topography and orographic barriers on climate extremes. Species occupying hotter and drier locations that are exposed to severe maximum temperature extremes were associated with better predictive performance when modelled using extremes. Understanding how plant species have historically responded to climate extremes may provide valuable insights into our understanding of contemporary distributions and help to make more accurate predictions under a changing climate.},

  abstract = {The quantification of factors leading to harmfully high levels of particulate matter (PM) remains challenging. This study presents a novel approach using a statistical model that is trained to predict hourly concentrations of particles smaller than 10 m (PM10) by combining satellite-borne aerosol optical depth (AOD) with meteorological and land-use parameters. The model is shown to accurately predict PM10 (overall R = 0.77, RMSE = 7.44 g/m ) for measurement sites in Germany. The capability of satellite observations to map and monitor surface air pollution is assessed by investigating the relationship between AOD and PM10 in the same modeling setup. Sensitivity analyses show that important drivers of modeled PM10 include multiday mean wind flow, boundary layer height (BLH), day of year (DOY), and temperature. Different mechanisms associated with elevated PM10 concentrations are identified in winter and summer. In winter, mean predictions of PM10 concentrations {$>$}35 g/m occur when BLH is below 500 m. Paired with multiday easterly wind flow, mean model predictions surpass 40 g/m of PM10. In summer, PM10 concentrations seemingly are less driven by meteorology, but by emission or chemical particle formation processes, which are not included in the model. The relationship between AOD and predicted PM10 concentrations depends to a large extent on ambient meteorological conditions. Results suggest that AOD can be used to assess air quality at ground level in a machine learning approach linking it with meteorological conditions.},

  abstract = {Species distribution modelling (SDM), a tool increasingly adopted to quantify geographic range size, often predicts species' distributions as static. However, habitat availability may exhibit spatial and temporal variation when dynamic processes, such as fire, determine suitability. Static SDM approaches may not satisfactorily represent this dynamic process. We investigated the potential use of SDM to quantify dynamic habitat availability by applying the MaxEnt SDM technique to model the habitat of the Carpentarian Grasswren (Amytornis dorotheae), an endangered Australian passerine dependent on long unburnt vegetation in a fire prone system. By adjusting a typical SDM approach to incorporate the dynamic nature of fire, we modelled the spatio-temporal variation of suitable habitat over 12 years and compared it to a static modelling approach. Incorporating fire as a dynamic process increased the importance of the fire variable to models (from {$<$}18\% to {$>$}35\% permutation importance) and improved model performance, as evaluated by the AUC using cross-validation. Our dynamic model revealed sizeable temporal variation in the area and spatial arrangement of suitable habitat that was not apparent in the static model. This result may partly solve the mystery of why the species occurs as widely separated populations despite the presence of seemingly suitable intervening habitat. In areas where the species is no longer found, habitat availability was less consistent due to frequent fire, and fire refugia was more limited and isolated, when compared to sites with recent records. These results demonstrate that, when compared to a static approach, a dynamic SDM approach can lead to improved understanding of dynamic ecological processes, and their impact on a species.},

  abstract = {Land-use change can have local-to-global environment impacts such as loss of biodiversity and climate change as well as social-economic impacts such as social inequality. Models that are built to analyze land-use change can help us understand the causes and effects of change, which can provide support and evidence to land-use planning and land-use policies to eliminate or alleviate potential negative outcomes. A variety of modelling approaches have been developed and implemented to represent land-use change, in which statistical methods are often used in the classification of land use as well as to test hypotheses about the significance of potential drivers of land-use change. The utility of statistical models is found in the ease of their implementation and application as well as their ability to provide a general representation of land-use change given a limited amount of time, resources, and data. Despite the use of many different statistical methods for modelling land-use change, comparison among more than two statistical methods is rare and an evaluation of the performance of a combination of different statistical methods with the same dataset is lacking. The presented research fills this gap in land-use modelling literature using four statistical methods\textemdash Markov chain, logistic regression, generalized additive models and survival analysis\textemdash to quantify their ability to represent land-use change. The four methods were compared across three dimensions: accuracy (overall and by land-use type), sample size, and spatial independence via conventional and spatial cross-validation. Our results show that the generalized additive model outperformed the other three models in terms of overall accuracy and was the best for modelling most land-use changes with both conventional and spatial cross-validation regardless of sample size. Logistic regression and survival analysis were more accurate for specific land-use types, and Markov chain was able to represent those changes that could not be modeled by other approaches due to sample size restrictions. Spatial cross-validation accuracies were slightly lower than the conventional cross-validation accuracies. Our results demonstrate that not only is the choice of model by land-use type more important than sample size, but also that a hybrid land-use model comprising the best statistical modelling approaches for each land-use change can outperform individual statistical approaches. While Markov chain was not competitive, it was useful in providing representation using other methods or in other cases where there is no predictor data.},

  abstract = {Understanding the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) content over different climatic regions will enhance our knowledge of carbon gains and losses due to climatic change. However, little is known about the SOC content in the contrasting arid and sub-humid regions of Iran, whose complex SOC\&ndash;landscape relationships pose a challenge to spatial analysis. Machine learning (ML) models with a digital soil mapping framework can solve such complex relationships. Current research focusses on ensemble ML models to increase the accuracy of prediction. The usual ensemble method is boosting or weighted averaging. This study proposes a novel ensemble technique: the stacking of multiple ML models through a meta-learning model. In addition, we tested the ensemble through rescanning the covariate space to maximize the prediction accuracy. We first applied six state-of-the-art ML models (i.e., Cubist, random forests (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), classical artificial neural network models (ANN), neural network ensemble based on model averaging (AvNNet), and deep learning neural networks (DNN)) to predict and map the spatial distribution of SOC content at six soil depth intervals for both regions. In addition, the stacking of multiple ML models through a meta-learning model with/without rescanning the covariate space were tested and applied to maximize the prediction accuracy. Out of six ML models, the DNN resulted in the best modeling accuracies, followed by RF, XGBoost, AvNNet, ANN, and Cubist. Importantly, the stacking of models indicated a significant improvement in the prediction of SOC content, especially when combined with rescanning the covariate space. For instance, the RMSE values for SOC content prediction of the upper 0\&ndash;5 cm of the soil profiles of the arid site and the sub-humid site by the proposed stacking approaches were 17\% and 9\% respectively, less than that obtained by the DNN models\&mdash;the best individual model. This indicates that rescanning the original covariate space by a meta-learning model can extract more information and improve the SOC content prediction accuracy. Overall, our results suggest that the stacking of diverse sets of models could be used to more accurately estimate the spatial distribution of SOC content in different climatic regions.},

  abstract = {Vanilla, an expensive but popular spice used in many industries, faces problems related to its supply. Some of these problems are due to the fact that vanilla cultivation is based on clonal material of a single species (Vanilla planifolia) and is dominated by just a few countries located outside the native growing areas of aromatic vanilla species, which is the neotropics. Despite the economic importance of this crop, relatively little attention has been paid to its wild relatives, in particular with respect to their biology, ecology, and potential use. We hypothesized that species distribution models (SDMs) can identify suitable areas for both the conservation and cultivation of vanilla crop wild relatives (CWRs), following a joint land sparing/land sharing (SPASHA) approach, thus offering alternative sourcing areas and production methods. This is the first study that explored the use of ensemble SDMs to provide applicable land use maps related to the conservation and sustainable cultivation of wild vanilla species in Costa Rica, contributing to a solution for the problems related to current vanilla production systems. We focused on four aromatic vanilla CWRs, native to Costa Rica, to make land use policy recommendations for this country, and more specifically for the biological corridor Osa and its surroundings within our study region \'Area de Conservaci\'on Osa (ACOSA). The resulting distribution maps, with a mean AUC of 0.89, reflected their current potential distribution (ranging from unsuitable to suitable) in Costa Rica. Combining them with recent land use and conservation area maps of our study region, we defined (1) areas for vanilla conservation and (2) areas for sustainable vanilla cultivation within agroforestry systems. These land use recommendations can now be integrated within the National Bio-Corridor Program (PNCB) that aims at making biological corridors more productive by proposing alternative income generation for local communities living within these areas. Our approach can be applied to identify priority areas for implementing the SPASHA approach on other vanilla CWRs and in more regions across its native growing ranges, given the availability of land use maps and enough occurrence records to build accurate SDMs.},

Manual digitising of aerial images with field verification is the standard method to create maps of the invasive Lupinus polyphyllus Lindl. (Lupine) in semi-natural grasslands of the UNESCO biosphere reserve ``Rh\"on''. As the standard method is labour-intensive, a workflow was developed to map lupine coverage using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne remote sensing (RS) along with object-based image analysis (OBIA). UAV-borne red, green, blue and thermal imaging, as well as photogrammetric canopy height modelling (CHM) were applied. Images were segmented by unsupervised parameter optimisation into image objects representing lupine plants and grass vegetation. Image objects obtained were classified using random forest classification modelling based on objects' attributes. The classification model was employed to create lupine distribution maps of test areas, and predicted data were compared with manually digitised lupine coverage maps. The classification models yielded a mean prediction accuracy of 89\%. The maximum difference in lupine area between classified and digitised lupine maps was 5\%. Moreover, the pixel-wise map comparison showed that 88\% of all pixels matched between classified and digitised maps. Our results indicated that lupine coverage mapping using UAV-borne RS data and OBIA provides similar results as the standard manual digitising method and, thus, offers a valuable tool to map invasive lupine on grasslands.},

To illustrate our points, climatologically averaged weather-station temperatures were obtained from the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN), Version 2, and then alternately interpolated spatially (gridded) using two spatial-interpolation procedures. Substantial differences in the performance of our two spatial interpolators are evident in maps of the cross-validation error fields, in the average-error statistics, as well as in estimated land-surface-average air temperatures that differ by more than 2\textdegree C. The RMSE and its square, the mean-square error (MSE), are of particular interest, because they are the most widely reported average-error measures, and they tend to be misleading. It (RMSE) is an inappropriate measure of average error because it is a function of three characteristics of a set of errors, rather than of one (the average error).

Biodiversity benchmark surveys traditionally require intense human labor inputs to find, identify, and record organisms limiting the rate and impact of scientific enquiry and discovery.

Community science web platforms, smartphone applications, and technology assisted identification have expedited the speed and enhanced the volume of observational data all while providing open access to these data worldwide. How to integrate and leverage the data into valuable information on how species are changing in space and time requires new best practices in computational and analytical approaches. Here we integrate data from three community science repositories to explore how a specialist herbivore distribution changes in relation to host plant distributions and other environmental factors. We generate a series of temporally-explicit species distribution models to generate range predictions for a specialist insect herbivore (Papilio cresphontes) and three predominant host-plant species. We find that this insect species has experienced rapid northern range expansion, likely due to a combination of the range of its larval host plants and climate changes in winter. This case study shows rapid data collection through large scale community science endeavors can be leveraged through thoughtful data integration and transparent analytic pipelines to inform how environmental change impacts where species are and their interactions for a more cost effective method of biodiversity benchmarking.},

  abstract = {Accurate spatialization of socioeconomic data is conducive to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of human social development status and, thus, effectively support future scientific decision-making. This study focuses on population mapping, which is a classical spatialization of macroeconomic data of the social economy. Traditional population mapping based on rough grids or administrative divisions such as townships often has deficiencies in the accuracy of spatial pattern and prediction. In this article, hence, we employ residential geo-objects as basic mapping units and formalize the problem as a spatial prediction process using machine-learning (ML) methods with high-spatial-resolution (HSR) satellite remote sensing images and multisource geospatial data. The indicators of population spatial density, including residential geo-objects' area, building existence index, terrain slope, night light intensity, density of point of interest (POI) and road network from Internet electronic maps, and locational factors such as the distances from road and river, are jointly applied to establish the relationship between these multivariable factors and quantitative index of population density using ML algorithms such as Random Forests and XGBoost. The predicated values of population density from the mined nonlinear regression relation are further used to calculate the weights of disaggregation of each unit, and then the population quantity distribution at the scale of residential geo-objects is obtained under the control of the total amount of population statistics. Experiments with a county area show that the methodology has the ability to achieve better results than the traditional deterministic methods by reproducing a more accurate and finer geographic population distribution pattern. Meanwhile, it is found that the optimization of mapping results may benefit from the multisources geospatial data, and thus the methodological framework can be recommended to be extended to other spatialization areas of socioeconomic data.},

  abstract = {Accurate assessments of grassland above-ground biomass (AGB) are crucial for the sustainable utilization and protection of grassland resources and the eco-environment. In this study, a random forest (RF) model combined with the forward feature selection (FFS) and leave-location-out cross-validation (LLO-CV) methods was trained to predict the dry weight (DW) of grassland AGB based on multiple factors. The final model exhibited a performance of R2~=~0.66, root mean square error (RMSE) of 503.86~kg DW/ha and mean absolute error (MAE) of 376.51~kg DW/ha. The spatial distribution of grassland AGB increased from northwest to southeast over the entire Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2001 to 2018. Grassland AGB increased more than it decreased (70.6\% vs 29.4\%, respectively) during the study period. Using a combination of FFS and LLO-CV, spatial overfitting was reduced, and the predictive accuracy of the RF was improved, thus enhancing the ability to predict the AGB in unknown locations from training data. This study proposes a robust methodology with which to improve the transferability of machine learning algorithms to predict grassland AGB in unknown locations.},

  abstract = {The Tibetan Plateau has been undergoing accelerated warming over recent decades, and is considered an indicator for broader global warming phenomena. However, our understanding of warming rates with elevation in complex mountain regions is incomplete. The most serious concern is the lack of high-quality near-surface air temperature (Tair) datasets in these areas. To address this knowledge gap, we developed an automated mapping framework for the estimation of seamless daily minimum and maximum Land Surface Temperatures (LSTs) for the Tibetan Plateau from the existing MODIS LST products for a long period of time (i.e., 2002\&ndash;present). Specific machine learning methods were developed and linked with target-oriented validation and then applied to convert LST to Tair. Spatial variables in retrieving Tair, such as solar radiation and vegetation indices, were used in estimation of Tair, whereas MODIS LST products were mainly focused on temporal variation in surface air temperature. We validated our process using independent Tair products, revealing more reliable estimates on Tair; the R2 and RMSE at monthly scales generally fell in the range of 0.9\&ndash;0.95 and 1\&ndash;2 \&deg;C. Using these continuous and consistent Tair datasets, we found temperature increases in the elevation range between 2000\&ndash;3000 m and 4000\&ndash;5000 m, whereas the elevation interval at 6000\&ndash;7000 m exhibits a cooling trend. The developed datasets, findings and methodology contribute to global studies on accelerated warming.},

  abstract = {Aim Predicting the spatial distribution of species assemblages remains an important challenge in biogeography. Recently, it has been proposed to extend correlative species distribution models (SDMs) by taking into account (a) covariance between species occurrences in so-called joint species distribution models (JSDMs) and (b) ecological assembly rules within the SESAM (spatially explicit species assemblage modelling) framework. Yet, little guidance exists on how these approaches could be combined. We, thus, aim to compare the accuracy of assemblage predictions derived from stacked and from joint SDMs. Location Switzerland. Taxon Birds, tree species. Methods Based on two monitoring schemes (national forest inventory and Swiss breeding bird atlas), we built SDMs and JSDMs for tree species (at 100 m resolution) and forest birds (at 1 km resolution). We tested accuracy of species assemblage and richness predictions on holdout data using different stacking procedures and ecological assembly rules. Results Despite minor differences, results were consistent between birds and tree species. Cross-validated species-level model performance was generally higher in SDMs than JSDMs. Differences in species richness and assemblage predictions were larger between stacking procedures and ecological assembly rules than between stacked SDMs and JSDMs. On average, predictions were slightly better for stacked SDMs compared to JSDMs, probabilistic stacks outperformed binary stacks, and ecological assembly rules yielded best predictions. Main conclusions When predicting the composition of species assemblages, the choice of stacking procedure and ecological assembly rule seems more decisive than differences in underlying model type (SDM vs. JSDM). JSDMs do not seem to improve community predictions compared to SDMs or improve predictions for rare species. Still, JSDMs may provide additional insights into community assembly and may help deriving hypotheses about prevailing biotic interactions in the system. We provide simple rules of thumb for choosing appropriate modelling pathways. Future studies should test these preliminary guidelines for other taxa and biogeographical realms as well as for other JSDM algorithms.},
