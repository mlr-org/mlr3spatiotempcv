# Introduction

This package provides resampling methods for the {mlr3} package framework suited for spatial and temporal data.

Calling `library("mlr3spatiotempcv")`, makes the spatial resampling methods and example tasks available to the user.

### Task types

```{r}
mlr_reflections$task_types
```

### Task column roles

```{r}
# note the addtional "coordinates" slot
mlr_reflections$task_col_roles
```

### Resampling methods

```{r, warning=FALSE}
as.data.table(mlr_resamplings)
```

Currently, the following resampling methods are implemented:

## Usage

To create a spatial task, use class `TaskClassifST` for classification and `TaskRegrST` for regression tasks.
Please make sure that your dataset comes with coordinates since they are needed during the construction of the class (see the next code chunk).
In addition, one can specify whether the coordinates should be used as features during the modeling.
By default, coordinates are not used as features and will be removed from the feature dataset after the coordinates have been added as a method to the task.
For optional plotting purposes, it is recommended to also pass the PROJ string specifying the used coordinate reference system via the `crs` argument.

```{r}
data = mlr3::as_data_backend(ecuador)

ecuador = TaskClassifST$new(
  id = "ecuador", backend = data, target = "slides",
  positive = "TRUE", coordinate_names = c("x", "y"), coords_as_features = FALSE,
  crs = "+proj=utm +zone=17 +south +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs")
```

The "ecuador" dataset consists of a response variable named `slides` (boolean; see Figure \@ref(fig:lsl)) and various predictor variables that might have an influence on the occurrence of landslides such as slope, curvature or catchment area.^[Please note that the "ecuador" task is also available via `tsk(ecuador)`.]
For a detailed overview of the dataset, please refer to @brenning_landslide_2015 and/or Chapter 11 of [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-cv.html) [@lovelace_geocomputation_2019].


```{r lsl, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Landslide initiation points (red) and non-landslide points (blue) in Southern Ecuador. Figure taken from @lovelace_geocomputation_2019.", fig.align="center", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/figures/lsl-map-1.png")
```

Printing a spatial task, also displays a preview of the coordinates.

```{r}
ecuador
```

After the task has been constructed, it can be used in conjunction with all available resampling methods.
However, non-spatial methods should **only be used to showcase the degree of overoptimistic performance estimates** compared to a chosen spatiotemporal resampling method [@schratz2019].

### Resampling

To showcase the usage with code, we will adapt the basic [resampling example of the mlr3book](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/resampling.html) by using the "ecuador" example task that comes with the {mlr3spatiotempcv} package.
To predict landslide occurrence, we will use a simple decision tree.
To emphasize that common, i.e., non-spatial, cross-validation is usually over-optimistic, we will first execute a 5-repeated 5-fold cross-validation with the help of the `"repeated-cv"` resampling method.

```{r}
learner = lrn("classif.rpart", maxdepth = 3, predict_type = "prob")
resampling_nsp = rsmp("repeated_cv", folds = 5, repeats = 5)
rr_nsp = resample(
  task = ecuador, learner = learner,
  resampling = resampling_nsp)

rr_nsp$aggregate(measures = msr("classif.ce"))
```

However, as emphasized before, the "ecuador" landslides dataset is a spatial dataset, i.e., that each observation comes with xy-coordinates.
And points close to each other tend to be more similar than points further apart.
Spatial cross-validation takes this into account by putting points close to each other either into the training or the test dataset (see Figure \@ref(fig:ressp)).
For more details on (spatial) cross-validation, please refer to @brenning2012 and @schratz2019.
For a gentle introduction to spatial cross-validation, please refer to Chapter 11 of [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-cv.html) [@lovelace_geocomputation_2019].
Hence, let's do the cross-validation again, this time taking into account the spatial dimension.

```{r}
resampling_sp = rsmp("repeated-spcv-coords", folds = 5, repeats = 5)

rr_sp = resample(
  task = ecuador, learner = learner,
  resampling = resampling_sp)

rr_sp$aggregate(measures = msr("classif.ce"))
```

We see that the classical non-spatial CV performs better.
However, "better" in this case actually means overoptimistic and biased [@burman1994; @cliff1970; @racine2000; @schratz2019].
Hence, it is highly recommended to **not** use classical CV methods with spatiotemporal data but rather choose an appropriate spatiotemporal method.

## Visualization

This package follows the {mlr3} ecosystem idea of providing `autoplot()` methods for certain classes.

For an exhaustive overview, have a look at the [reference section for the autoplot method](https://mlr3spatiotempcv.mlr-org.com/reference/autoplot_spatial_resampling.html) on the pkgdown site of this package.

To showcase the usage, we will visualize both resampling methods which we created for the comparison we just did above.

### Spatial 

Multiple options exists.
If no specific fold is specified, all partitions will be returned distinguished by color.

```{r ressp, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Example for five spatially disjoint partitions constructed with the `repeated_cv` resampling method."}
plot(resampling_sp, task = ecuador, crs = 4326)
```

### Non-spatial

```{r, fig.align='center'}
plot(resampling_nsp, task = ecuador, crs = 4326)
```
